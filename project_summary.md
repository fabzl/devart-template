## Description

How much information is out there in the web ? <br>
What amount of it you able to see everyday?<br>
How much of that info can we display at the same time?<br>

Overconnected is an allegoric representation of the internet.
Using web crawlers to browse through the web and store thousands of random information coming from different websites around the world. 

The aim is display a several amount of random images using thousands of them to create a visual representation of the immensity of web. Also somehow deveiling the strange demographics of the content itself. To show something that we can see but we will never be able to see it all.
Losing his original context all the information is abandon to his true nature 
reduced just be part of an endless and slowly ocean of data.

Under the hood overconnected used to main algorithms: 

Collector:

Exhibitor : 
Reads the information stored and place it in the grid is dedicated create an developing flow of information using animation based on Three.js
